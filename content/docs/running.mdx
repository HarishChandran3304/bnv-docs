There are 2 ways to use better-env to run projects:

## 1) Load and Unload Secrets 
### Load secrets

You can load secrets into your shell by running the following command:

```bash
bnv load
```

You will be prompted for:

- The passphrase for your OpenPGP key

This will set the environment variables in your shell using the function wrapper you have set up in your shell config.
This is how it works:
1) It reads the `.better-env` file in your current directory to determine which secrets to load.
2) Then it uses your OpenPGP key to decrypt them and fetch them from the global store.
3) Once fetched it sets each secret as an environment variable in your shell.
4) You can do an `echo $KEY` to verify that the secret is set.
5) Now, you can run any program that uses environment variables to access the secrets.

### Unload secrets

You can unload secrets from your shell by running the following command:

```bash
bnv unload
```

This will unset the environment variables in your shell.

## 2) Run the command directly

You can run a command directly by running the following command:

```bash
bnv run YOUR COMMAND
```
For example:
```bash
bnv run python3 main.py
```

This will run the command with the environment variables and secrets loaded from your project configuration.
This is how it works:
1) It reads the `.better-env` file in your current directory to determine which secrets to load.
2) Then it uses your OpenPGP key to decrypt them and fetch them from the global store.
3) It internally runs the command with the environment variables and secrets loaded like so:
```bash
python3 main.py KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2 ...
```

This method is way safer and the recommended way to use better-env since only the child process will have access to the secrets..
