There are 2 ways to use better-env to run projects:

## 1) Start an interactive shell
You can start an interactive shell with secrets loaded by running the following command:
```bash
bnv shell
# python3 main.py
exit
```
This will start an interactive shell with the secrets loaded from your project configuration.
You can run any commands/programs here and they will have access to the secrets.
Type `exit` to exit the shell.

## 2) Run the command directly
You can run a command directly by running the following command:
```bash
bnv run YOUR COMMAND
```
For example:
```bash
bnv run python3 main.py
```

This will run the command with the environment variables and secrets loaded from your project configuration.
This is how it works:
1) It reads the `.better-env` file in your current directory to determine which secrets to load.
2) Then it uses your OpenPGP key to decrypt them and fetch them from the global store.
3) It internally runs the command with the environment variables and secrets loaded like so:
```bash
python3 main.py KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2 ...
```

This method is way safer and the recommended way to use better-env since only the child process will have access to the secrets.

## `bnv shell` vs `bnv run`

|  | `bnv shell` | `bnv run` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How it works | Starts an interactive subshell with secrets injected into its environment; variables exist only inside that subshell. | Starts the command in a child process with secrets injected only for that process; parent shell remains untouched. |
| Pros | Great for interactive sessions; can run multiple commands without prefixing; isolated from the parent shell; secrets cleaned up when you exit. | Safer by default; secrets are ephemeral to the child process; no shell setup required; ideal for scripts/CI and one-off commands; automatic cleanup. |
| Cons | Secrets live for the lifetime of the subshell and can be inherited by any processes you launch from it; requires staying in that shell. | Must prefix each command; slightly less convenient for long interactive sessions. |

<Callout type="tip">
  Prefer `bnv shell` for most workflows; use `bnv run` when you need to run a one-off command with secrets.
