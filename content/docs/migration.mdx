## Migrating from .env

You can migrate from .env to better-env by running the following command:

```bash
bnv migrate /path/to/your/.env
```

This will migrate the secrets from the .env file to the global store.

You will be prompted for the following:
- Passphrase for your OpenPGP key
- If you want to delete the .env file after migration
- If you want to create a matching .better-env file in the same directory
