### Step 1
Run the following command to begin the setup:
```bash
bnv setup
```

This will walk you through setting up an OpenPGP key and creating the config directory.
You will be prompted for:

- Your name
- Your email address
- A passphrase to encrypt your PGP key


### Step 2
Update your shell config to load secrets into your shell.
You will be given a command to run that will add a function to your shell config.
This is necessary to load secrets into your shell (`bnv load` command).

```bash tab="zsh"
echo 'bnv() { if [ "$1" = "load" ]; then eval "$(command bnv load)"; elif [ "$1" = "unload" ]; then eval "$(command bnv unload)"; else command bnv "$@"; fi }' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

```bash tab="bash"
echo 'bnv() { if [ "$1" = "load" ]; then eval "$(command bnv load)"; elif [ "$1" = "unload" ]; then eval "$(command bnv unload)"; else command bnv "$@"; fi }' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

```bash tab="others"
# Add the following to your shell config and restart your shell 
bnv() {
  if [ "$1" = "load" ]; then
    eval "$(command bnv load)"
  elif [ "$1" = "unload" ]; then
    eval "$(command bnv unload)"
  else
    command bnv "$@"
  fi
}
```

  You can skip this step if you don't want to use the `bnv load` command (You can use `bnv run` instead). Check [Running Projects](./running) for more details.
