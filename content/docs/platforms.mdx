<Callout type="warning">
Please note:
- `bnv run` works as expected.
- `bnv shell` attempts to launch `pwsh`, then `powershell`, then `cmd.exe` for an interactive session with secrets. Shell startup semantics differ from POSIX shells, so profile scripts may not run the same.
- For the best experience on Windows, consider WSL or Git Bash/MSYS2.
