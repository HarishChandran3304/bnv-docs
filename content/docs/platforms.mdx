## Windows

Status: Partial support

Works:
- `setup`, `init`, `store`, `update`, `delete`, `rename`, `show`, `copy`, `import`, `add`, `remove`, `list`, `run`

Limitations:
- load / unload print POSIX export/unset lines and won’t affect PowerShell/cmd parent shells.

Workarounds:
- Prefer `bnv run` to execute your app with secrets in the child process environment on native Windows. (Recommended)
- Use Git Bash or WSL to enable `load`/`unload` via the shell function.

Planned:
- Native PowerShell integration.
