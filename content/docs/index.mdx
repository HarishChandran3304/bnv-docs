## Introduction

better-env is a simple, secure CLI tool to manage environment variables centrally on your machine using OpenPGP encryption.
Keep your secrets out of repos and out of plaintext files, loading them into apps only at runtime.
Never accidentally commit secrets again. `.better-env` files are fully commit-safe.

## Installation

### Linux/MacOS
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarishChandran3304/better-env/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

### Windows
```bash
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarishChandran3304/better-env/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Setup

```bash
bnv setup
```
You will be prompted to setup a new OpenPGP key.

## Usage

### 1) Store secrets (one-time)

```bash
bnv store KEY
```

### 2) Import and use secrets

```bash
cd /path/to/my/project
bnv init
bnv add KEY

# Interactive shell (recommended)
bnv shell
# ... your commands here ...
exit

# One-off command
bnv run python3 main.py
```

The idea is you store the secrets once in the global store, and you can import and use them in your projects whenever you want.

## Core concepts
- The Global Store: A single encrypted store of all your secrets lives in the user's config directory.
- The Project Link: Each project has a `.better-env` file that lists which keys the project uses.
- Two ways to use secrets:
  - `bnv shell`: start an interactive shell with secrets loaded
  - `bnv run`: run a command with secrets only available to the child process
