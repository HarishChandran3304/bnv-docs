## Initialize better-env

You can initialize better-env for your project by running the following command:

```bash
bnv init
```
This will create an empty `.better-env` file in your current directory.

## Add secrets

You can add a secret to your project by running the following command:

```bash
bnv add KEY
```
This will add the secret to the `.better-env` file in your current directory.

    Remember that no validation happens on the keys being added to your project, so make sure they exist in the global store before adding to prevent unexpected behavior.

## View secrets

You can view the secrets in your project by running the following command:

```bash
bnv list
```
This will output the list of secrets in your project to stdout.

## Remove secrets

You can remove a secret from your project by running the following command:

```bash
bnv remove KEY
```
This will remove the secret from the `.better-env` file in your current directory.
